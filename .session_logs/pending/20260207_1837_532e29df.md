## User

Try to invoke session-memory:setup. What error do you get?

### Actions

- 🔧 Skill(skill=...)

## Claude

The error is:

> **Skill session-memory:setup cannot be used with Skill tool due to disable-model-invocation**

This means the `session-memory:setup` skill has the `disable-model-invocation` flag set, which prevents it from being invoked programmatically by the model via the Skill tool. It can likely only be triggered by the user directly (e.g., typing `/session-memory:setup` in the CLI), not by the AI agent itself.
